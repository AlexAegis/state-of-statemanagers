# ngrx

## Pros

### Router store

In angular it's not easy to decypher what the router is doing. With Router
store we get actions for the events and clear to use observables to listen to
them.

## Cons

### Unopinionated

It's not opinionated and it's entirely up to the user how you structure your
store. Many things can be constructed in multiple ways. (createEffect, @Effect)
